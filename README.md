# Postman API Testing 🔥🚀

### 🚀 **Postman API Testing & Automation Summary** 🚀

Postman is a powerful tool for both **manual API testing** and **automating API workflows**, making it essential for developers to test, debug, and document APIs efficiently. Here's a combined overview of both API testing and automation in Postman:

---

#### 🛠️ **1. Installation & Setup**

- Install Postman as a desktop or web app.
- Create an account to save and manage your API requests easily.

#### 🌐 **2. Creating & Sending API Requests**

- Select the request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Enter the API endpoint (URL), parameters, headers, and authentication details.
- Click **Send** to get a response and view status codes (e.g., 200, 404) and response data (JSON, XML, etc.).

---

### 🧪 **API Testing in Postman** 🧪

#### ✅ **3. Writing Tests & Assertions**

- Write **JavaScript tests** to validate API responses, status codes, or check specific data fields.
- Example: Ensure a status code is 200 or a JSON field exists.

#### 🗂️ **4. Collections**

- Organize related API requests into **Collections**, which can be reused and shared easily.

#### 🌍 **5. Environment Variables**

- Use **Environment Variables** to store values like API keys, URLs, and tokens to switch between different environments (dev, test, prod) seamlessly.

---

### 🤖 **Postman Automation** 🤖

#### 🚀 **6. Collection Runner**

- Run multiple API requests and tests in a **Collection** automatically.
- View detailed test results like passed/failed tests, response times, and errors.

#### 📊 **7. Data-Driven Testing**

- Automate testing with **CSV/JSON** files by running the same request with multiple sets of input data.

#### 🖥️ **8. Newman CLI**

- Use **Newman**, Postman’s command-line tool, to run collections via the terminal.
- Integrate Postman tests into your **CI/CD pipelines** to automate testing with each code deployment.

#### ⏲️ **9. Postman Monitors**

- Schedule **Monitors** to automate tests at specific intervals, ensuring APIs continue to perform well over time.

#### ⚙️ **10. Pre-Request & Post-Request Scripting**

- Use **Pre-request scripts** to automate tasks before requests (e.g., setting headers, generating tokens).
- Use **Post-request scripts** to automate tasks after requests, like **chaining** requests by passing data between them.

---

### 🔄 **Continuous Testing & Monitoring** 🔄

#### 📡 **11. Integration with CI/CD Tools**

- Postman integrates with tools like **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, and others to automate tests as part of your CI/CD process.

#### 🕵️‍♂️ **12. Mock Servers**

- Set up **Mock Servers** to simulate APIs for testing workflows when the actual API isn’t ready.

---

### ✨ **Key Benefits** ✨

- 🕒 **Save Time**: Automate repetitive API testing tasks.
- 🐞 **Catch Bugs Early**: Run tests continuously with each code deployment.
- 📈 **Ensure API Stability**: Use monitors for ongoing API health checks.
- 🤝 **Team Collaboration**: Share collections and documentation with your team easily.

Postman’s powerful API testing and automation capabilities streamline both development and testing workflows, ensuring efficient, reliable, and scalable API operations.
